**From Joe Hegarty, Lead Engineer**: <br /><br/>
_Hi Everyone,<br /><br />
I was honored to travel to JavaOne in San Francisco to accept the 2016 Duke's Choice Award for Open Source on behalf of the Orbit project. <br /><br />
Orbit has been a real team effort ranging from the initial internal engineering efforts at EA and the efforts of our legal team to make Orbit EA's first community project to the amazing contributions from our open source community. The Duke's Choice Award recognizes the effort that everyone has contributed over the past couple of years to get Orbit to where it is. I'm extremely proud of the achievement that we've made together.<br /> <br />
